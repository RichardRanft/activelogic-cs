If you need a commercial license consider purchasing the Unity [Asset Store package](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/151850). Since the Github package is a subset of the Asset store package, this may suffice.

Should you need another license, for example - to redistribute the library alongside closed source software [get in touch](mailto:active.behaviours@gmail.com).
