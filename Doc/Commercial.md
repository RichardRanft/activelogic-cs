## Commercial licensing information

If you need a commercial license, please consider purchasing the Unity Asset Store package. Simply, the asset store package is cheaper and (provided you are using Unity) more comprehensive.

Otherwise, you may acquire licenses via [the Fair Source License](../FAIR-SOURCE-LICENSE). This is a per seat license, with a graceful provision for one user ("fair source one") to use the software for free.

Beyond one user a fee of USD35 per seat is applicable. Process your payment [here](https://paypal.me/activelogic), clearly indicating the name of your organization and the number of seats covered by the transaction.

If you have any question or would like to request a volume discount, [get in touch](mailto:active.behaviours@gmail.com).
